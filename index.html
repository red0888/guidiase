      <summary><b>Why are my tokens getting banned so fast?</b></summary>
      <p><u>This happens either because of the following reasons:</u></p>
      <p>1- There is a current Discord ban wave going on (OR)</p>
      <p>2- There is an issue with your proxy/IP/token configuration.</p>
      <p><u>Solution:</u></p>
      <p>In case of of a Discord ban wave, all you can do is wait. Ban waves happen randomly and we cannot guess when they take place. All you can do is wait for it to end. One of the signs of a ban wave is sudden disabling of tokens and the
        inability
        to create new ones properly. In the second case, it might be because you are sending too many DM's, in which case adding a short delay is better. It might also be that cheap proxies such as public ones or LQ Russian phone numbers can also
        cause this issue.Make sure to use good
        quality phone numbers such as Ukraine, Estonia etc. Visit <a href="https://xyliase.com/guide">Xyliase Guide</a> for more info about this.</p>

  <h2>Useful Tips:</h2>
  <p>1- If you face any errors first look at the logs. usually they provide more than sufficient information. After you see the logs, visit <a href="https://xyliase.com/guide">Xyliase Guide</a> for more info on what the error is.</p>
  <p>2- A really good tip is to not cheap out while purchasing inputs requires for the tool. Don't buy Russian numbers because they're cheap. Don't buy Mail.ru accounts because they're cheap. Don't buy AI captcha service because it's cheap.
    Always make sure to get good Proxies, Phone number and E-mails. It's better to have 10 HQ tokens that send 50-100 DM's each rather than wasting money and making 50 tokens that send 5 DM's each.</p>
  <p>3- While purchasing proxies, always use a free trial/1 day plan provided by them. This allows you to easily check compatability issues with the tool.</p>
