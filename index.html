    <summary><b>Where can I get good proxies?</b></summary>
    <p>To avoid polluting our proxy sources, it is recommended for you to find one on your own. You can use means like <a href="https://cracked.to">cracked.to</a>, <a href="https://nulled.to">nulled.to</a>, <a href="https://mc-market.org">mc-market</a> and other similar websites to purchase them.

      <summary><b>Why are my tokens getting banned so fast?</b></summary>
      <p><u>This happens either because of the following reasons:</u></p>
      <p>1- There is a current Discord ban wave going on (OR)</p>
      <p>2- There is an issue with your proxy/IP/token configuration.</p>
      <p><u>Solution:</u></p>
      <p>In case of of a Discord ban wave, all you can do is wait. Ban waves happen randomly and we cannot guess when they take place. All you can do is wait for it to end. One of the signs of a ban wave is sudden disabling of tokens and the inabiility
        to create new ones properly. In the second case, it might be because you are sending too many DM's, in which case adding a short delay is better. It might also be that cheap proxies such as public ones or LQ Russian phone numbers can also cause this issue.Make sure to use good
        quality phone numbers such as Ukraine, Estonia etc. Visit <a href="https://xyliase.com/guide">Xyliase Guide</a> for more info about this.</p>
